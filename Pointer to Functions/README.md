## Submitted by - [Gursimran Singh (2310997089)](https://github.com/gursimrxn) on 10 March 2024

### Introduction

This program demonstrates function overloading in C++ by defining a `sample` class with various member functions such as `findFactorial`, `findSquare`, and `findCube`. The program allows the user to specify an argument from the command line and computes the factorial, square, and cube of that argument using function pointers.

### Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable with an integer argument from the command line.

Example usage:

- `./Pointer-to-functions 5`
- `./Pointer-to-functions 10`
- `etc...`

This will compute the factorial, square, and cube of the specified integer.
