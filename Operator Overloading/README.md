## Submitted by - [Gursimran Singh](https://github.com/gursimrxn) on 10 March 2024

### Introduction

This C++ program implements a simple user management system using a `User` class. The `User` class represents a user with attributes such as name, birth date, and salary. It provides methods to display user details, compare user ages, compute the average salary of two users, and increment a user's salary. Additionally, the program overloads the equality operator (`==`) to compare user birth dates and the addition operator (`+`) to compute the average salary and increment a user's salary.


### Functionality

- The program creates two `User` objects with the names "Raj" and "Mohan" and their respective attributes.
- It compares the ages of the two users using the `==` operator overload and prints the result.
- It computes the average salary of the two users using the `+` operator overload and prints the result.
- It increments the salary of one of the users by a specified percentage and prints the salary before and after incrementation.
- It displays the details of both users, including their names, birth dates, and salaries.
