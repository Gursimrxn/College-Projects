# Proper Memory Management with Copy Constructor
## Submitted by - [Gursimran Singh](https://github.com/gursimrxn) on 2024-03-09

### Introduction

- This C++ program demonstrates the proper memory management techniques for a class named `sample`. The program includes a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, a copy constructor, and a destructor to manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation correctly.

### Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

### Functionality

- Implemented a new copy constructor to resolve memory management issues in the `sample` class. This new `constructor` ensures proper allocation of memory for new objects, preventing `memory leaks`. Tested the changes in `main()` by copying and modifying `sample` objects without affecting the original data. Cheers!
